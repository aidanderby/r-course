# Day 1

## Intro to R

-  No activity, just encourage folks to go along with us, get comfortable
-  Still have short break

## Reading Data

-  Read in some data and plot (e.g.) nox:co2 over time 
  - Date in different format to example
  - Nox:CO2 needs calculating/adding w/ mutate

## Basic Stats

-  Get the Nox/CO2 gradient from earlier data
-  Calculate the mean NOx:CO2

## openair

-  Open ended, go through openair manual, try out some of the plots that sound cool!

# Day 2

## Reading many data

- Same data as yesterday, but Read it in with a loop!
  
## Manipulation

- Use data, pivot longer, find mean and sd; find the max and min values for each species

## ggplot

- Plot something with the data you've got

## final exercise

-  Large, open ended exercise.
