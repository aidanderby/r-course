# WACL R Intro

Materials for WACL's Intro to R Course.
This course is split into 2 sessions: the first is a general introduction to R (`courses/r-intro`), and the second is a data visualization specific session (`courses/dataviz`).

Before attending the course, ideally you will have completed the following pre-requisites:

  - Read through sections 1 & 2 of the self-help materials (TODO: Can we place this here?)
  - Downloaded and installed [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
  - 'Cloned' a copy of this repository to your computer:
    - Click the Green `Code` button and copy the `HTTPS` URL
    - In RStudio click File -> New Project -> Version Control -> Git
    - For the `Repository URL` copy the GitHub link
    - It should populate the repository name text box
    - Choose an appropriate top level folder. You might want to make a `repos` folder in your Documents or somewhere easily accessible to store future repositories in, or an `RProjects` folder

## R Introduction

This session will take place over the course of a full day (10am-4pm) and will be split into 3 parts:

  - General familiarity working with data in R
  - `openair` introduction
  - Flow control and tidy data
  
The `courses/r-intro` folder is structured as follows:

  - `data`: Contains all data needed in the course
  - `docs`: Contains all presentations and notes used in delivering the course
  - `scripts`: Where you will write your R code in the corresponding year's folder, in the file named with the corresponding day.
  - `feedback`: Feedback from previous sessions (TODO put solely in Google Drive)
  - `exercise_answers.R`: Answers to the exercises, please don't look unless you get extremely stuck
  - `get_data.R`: Script for downloading the datasets again if needed

## Data Visualisation
