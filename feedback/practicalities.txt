Remember to bring extension cables from WACL; not all rooms have many sockets and some very large rooms have surprisingly few.

Try to book rooms well in advance to secure one with proper tables, and not just chairs with the side tables attached.

Bring snacks.

Teas and coffees can be sorted by Jenny, but do remember to bring milk from WACL and encourage attendees to bring mugs.
