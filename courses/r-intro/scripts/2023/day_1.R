# Enter your code here as you follow along with the session
# If just want to try things out, use the Console below interactively until you've got
# code you're happy with, and then copy it into here.

# It's good practice to 'Comment' your code with text annotations such as these.
# Anything following a # in R will not be treated as code. Use it to explain what lines are
# doing, or to add reminders to yourself. Just because you understand what your code is doing
# right now, it doesn't mean it will make sense a few months from now!
